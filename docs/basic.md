# A basic similarity search workflow

## Artifical example

Here is a simple, artificial example how 2. can be used:

```r
library(magrittr)
set.seed(145)

# a function to calculate the similarity probability for one particular sample
locate_simple <- mobest::locate(
  # spatiotemporal coordinates of the reference samples informing the ancestry field
  independent = mobest::create_spatpos(
    id = 1:100,
    x = c(sample(100000:700000, 50), sample(300000:1000000, 50)), # space x
    y = c(sample(100000:700000, 50), sample(300000:1000000, 50)), # space y
    z = c(sample(-5000:-3500, 50), sample(-4500:-3000, 50))       # time
  ),
  # genetic coordinates of the reference samples
  dependent = mobest::create_obs(
    ac1 = c(runif(50, 0, 0.6), runif(50, 0.4, 1)), # PCA coordinate 1
    ac2 = c(runif(50, 0, 0.3), runif(50, 0.5, 1))  # PCA coordinate 2
  ),
  # field properties for each ancestry component
  kernel = mobest::create_kernset(
    ac1 = mobest::create_kernel(1000000, 1000000, 200, 0.1),
    ac2 = mobest::create_kernel(1000000, 1000000, 200, 0.1)
  ),
  # spatiotemporal coordinates of the sample of interest
  search_independent = mobest::create_spatpos(
    id = 1,
    x = sample(100000:1000000, 1), # space x
    y = sample(100000:1000000, 1), # space y
    z = sample(-5000:-3000, 1)     # time
  ),
  # genetic coordinates of the sample of interest
  search_dependent = mobest::create_obs(
    ac1 = runif(1, 0, 0.6), # PCA coordinate 1
    ac2 = runif(1, 0, 0.5)  # PCA coordinate 2
  ),
  # spatial search grid: Where to search
  search_space_grid = expand.grid(
      x = seq(100000, 1000000, 100000), 
      y = seq(100000, 1000000, 100000)
    ) %>% { mobest::create_geopos(id = 1:nrow(.), x = .$x, y = .$y) },
  # search time: When to search
  search_time = -500,
  quiet = T
)

# multiply probabilities for PCA coordinate 1 and PCA coordinate 2
locate_product <- mobest::multiply_dependent_probabilities(locate_simple)

# plot the resulting probability surface
library(ggplot2)
locate_product %>% ggplot() +
  geom_raster(mapping = aes(x = field_x, y = field_y, fill = probability)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = search_x, y = search_y), colour = "red") +
  coord_fixed() +
  ggtitle(paste0(
    "t for sample of interest = ", unique(locate_product$search_z), "\n",
    "t field time slice = ", unique(locate_product$field_z)
  ))
```

## Origin search

`mobest::locate` uses the spatiotemporal interpolation to calculate a similarity probability between a set of "search" samples and an interpolation field. It requires the necessary reference sample input to perform the interpolation, which internally employs `mobest::create_model_grid` and `mobest::run_model_grid`. The search then yields a similarity probability value for each grid cell and for each search sample in an object of class `mobest_locateoverview`. These probabilities are normalized for each search sample and grid (with the default `normalize = TRUE`).

```r
locate_simple <- mobest::locate(
  independent = positions,
  dependent = observations,
  kernel = kernset,
  search_independent = positions[1:4,],
  search_dependent = observations[1:4,],
  search_space_grid = expand.grid(
      x = seq(100000, 1000000, 100000), 
      y = seq(100000, 1000000, 100000)
    ) %>% { mobest::create_geopos(id = 1:nrow(.), x = .$x, y = .$y) },
  search_time = c(0,-100),
  quiet = T
)
```

The spatiotemporal probability grids `locate` returns are calculated are per ancestry component (as put in via `dependent`/`search_dependent`). To multiply the ancestry component grids, `mobest` provides `mobest::multiply_dependent_probabilities`, which yields an object of class `mobest_locateproduct`. The output probabilities are normalized per permutation.

```r
mobest::multiply_dependent_probabilities(locate_simple)
```
