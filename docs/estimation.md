# Parameter estimation for optimal ancestry interpolation

One important question for the Gaussian process regression performed within multiple of the core functions of `mobest` is a correct and useful setting for the kernel parameters (see {ref}`Kernel parameter settings <basic:kernel parameter settings>` in the basic workflow description). Supplementary Text 2 of {cite:p}`Schmid2023` discusses this in detail. `mobest` provides different helper functions to either estimate the parameters or prepare data products that can be used to estimate them. Here we explain a practical way to estimate the nugget and lengthscale values.

For this tutorial we will use the data introduced and prepared in {doc}`A basic similarity search workflow <basic>`, specifically a `samples_projected.csv` table prepared in {ref}`Reading the input samples <basic:reading the input samples>`.

You can download a script with the main workflow explained below including the required test data here:

- [simple_similarity_search.R](data/simple_similarity_search.R)
- [samples_projected.csv](data/samples_projected.csv)

## Preparing the computational environment

```r
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
```

For more information see the {ref}`Preparing the computational environment <basic:preparing the computational environment>` section in the basic tutorial.

## Using a subset of the variogram to estimate the nugget parameter

We start by loading the input data - individual ancient DNA samples with their spatiotemporal and genetic position.

```r
samples_projected <- readr::read_csv("docs/data/samples_projected.csv")
# you have to replace "data/docs/" with the path to your copy of the file
```

### Determining pairwise distances

`mobest::calculate_pairwise_distances` allows to calculate different types of pairwise distances (spatial, temporal, dependent variables/ancestry components) for each input sample pair and returns them in a long format `tibble` of class `mobest_pairwisedistances`.

```r
distances_all <- mobest::calculate_pairwise_distances(
  independent = mobest::create_spatpos(
    id = samples_projected$Sample_ID,
    x = samples_projected$x,
    y = samples_projected$y,
    z = samples_projected$Date_BC_AD_Median
  ),
  dependent = mobest::create_obs(
    C1 = samples_projected$MDS_C1,
    C2 = samples_projected$MDS_C2
  )
)
```

Helper functions are available to calculate the individual types of distances, if this is desired.

```r
geo_dist  <- mobest::calculate_geo_pairwise_distances(positions)
time_dist <- mobest::calculate_time_pairwise_distances(positions)
obs_dist  <- mobest::calculate_dependent_pairwise_distances(positions$id, observations)
```

Spatial distances (`calculate_geo_pairwise_distances`) are assumed to be in meter and transformed to kilometres. This can be turned off with `m_to_km = FALSE`. `mobest::calculate_pairwise_distances()` also calculates the distances in dependent variables space on the residuals of a linear model informed from the spatiotemporal positions (see the `*_dist_resid` columns). This behaviour can be turned off by setting `with_resid = FALSE`.

`mobest_pairwisedistances`, here in `distances_all`, finally includes the following columns/variables.

|Column         |Description |
|:--------------|:-----------|
|id1            |Identifier of the first sample|
|id2            |Identifier of the second sample|
|geo_dist       |Spatial distance (in the units of the CRS, typically kilometres)|
|time_dist      |Temporal distance (typically in years)|
|obs_dist_total |Euclidean distance in the dependent variable space, so across all dimensions|
|\*_dist        |Distance in along the axis of one dependent variable denoted by \*|
|\*_dist_resid  |Distance for one dependent variable, but here only the distance in the space<br>defined by the residuals of a linear model|

This table allows us to easily visualize and analyse the pairwise distance properties of our dataset, for example with scatter plots or 2D histograms.

### Summarizing distances in an empirical variogram

`mobest::bin_pairwise_distances` bins the pairwise distances in an `mobest_pairwisedistances` object and calculates an empirical variogram (class `mobest_empiricalvariogram`) for the Euclidean distances in dependent variable space. `geo_bin` and `time_bin` set the spatial and temporal bin size. The `per_bin_operation` to summarize the information is per-default set to `function(x) { 0.5 * mean(x^2, na.rm = T) }`, so half-mean-squared.

```r
variogram <- mobest::bin_pairwise_distances(
  distances_all,
  geo_bin = 100, time_bin = 100
)
```

`mobest_empiricalvariogram` includes these columns/variables.

|Column         |Description |
|:--------------|:-----------|
|geo_dist_cut   |Upper bound of the spatial bin|
|time_dist_cut  |Upper bound of the temporal bin|
|obs_dist_total |Euclidean distance in the dependent variable space,<br>summarized with the `per_bin_operation`|
|C\*_dist       |Distance in along the axis of one dependent variable,<br>summarized with the `per_bin_operation`|
|C\*_dist_resid |Distance in residual space for one dependent variable,<br>summarized with the `per_bin_operation`|
|n              |Number of pairswise distances in a given space-time bin<br>(as shown in the 2D histograms in the previous section)|


### Estimating the nugget parameter

A form of the variogram can be used to estimate the nugget parameter of the GPR kernel settings, by filtering for pairwise "genetic" distances with very small spatial and temporal distances. Here is one workflow to do so.

```r
distances_for_nugget <- distances_all %>%
  # remove auto-distances
  dplyr::filter(id1 != id2) %>%
  # filter for small temporal and spatial pairwise distances
  dplyr::filter(time_dist < 50 & geo_dist < 50) %>%
  # transform the residual dependent variable distances
  # into a long format table
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = tidyselect::ends_with("_resid"),
    names_to = "dist_type", values_to = "dist_val"
  ) %>%
  # rescale the distances to relative proportions
  dplyr::mutate(
    dist_val_adjusted = dplyr::case_when(
      dist_type == "C1_dist_resid" ~
        0.5*(dist_val^2 / stats::var(samples_projected$MDS_C1)),
      dist_type == "C2_dist_resid" ~
        0.5*(dist_val^2 / stats::var(samples_projected$MDS_C2))
    )
  )
```

We remove the zero-distances from samples to themselves and then filter to very small spatial and temporal distances, so to pairs of samples that are very close in space and time. Within this subset we rescale the distances in dependent variable space, so genetic distances, to reflect a proportion of the variance of the samples in said space.

The mean of the resulting metric can be employed as the nugget value for a given dependent variable.

```r
estimated_nuggets <- distances_for_nugget %>%
  dplyr::group_by(dist_type) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(nugget = mean(dist_val_adjusted, na.rm = T))

# estimated_nuggets
# A tibble: 2 Ã— 2
  dist_type     nugget
  <chr>          <dbl>
1 C1_dist_resid 0.0710
2 C2_dist_resid 0.0589
```

## Finding optimal lengthscale parameters with crossvalidation

To find the empirically optimal lengthscale parameters mobest includes the function `mobest::crossvalidate`. It allows to tackle the parameter estimation challenge with simple crossvalidation across a grid of kernel parameters. This is a computationally expensive and mathematically inelegant method, but robust, reliable and readily understandable. `crossvalidate()` internally employs `mobest::create_model_grid` and `mobest::run_model_grid` (see {ref}`The permutation machine <advanced:the permutation machine>`).

### A basic crossvalidation setup

To run `mobest::crossvalidate` we require the spatiotemporal and dependent variable positions of the field-informing input samples, fixed nuggets for each dependent variable and a grid of kernel parameters to test.

The input positions can be specified as objects of type `mobest_spatiotemporalpositions` and `mobest_observations` just as laid out for `mobest::locate()` (see {ref}`Independent and dependent positions <basic:independent and dependent positions>`).

```r
ind <- mobest::create_spatpos(
  id = samples_projected$Sample_ID,
  x  = samples_projected$x,
  y  = samples_projected$y,
  z  = samples_projected$Date_BC_AD_Median
)
dep <- mobest::create_obs(
  C1 = samples_projected$MDS_C1,
  C2 = samples_projected$MDS_C2
)
```

The grid of kernel parameters grid is a bit more difficult to obtain. It has to be of type `mobest_kernelsetting_multi` (see {ref}`Permutation data types <types:permutation data types>`), which is a bit awkward to construct for a large set of value permutations. Here is one way of doing so.

```r
kernels_to_test <- expand.grid(
  ds = seq(100,200, 50)*1000,
  dt = seq(100,200, 50)
) %>% purrr::pmap(function(...) {
    row <- list(...)
    mobest::create_kernset(
      ac1 = mobest::create_kernel(row$ds, row$ds, row$dt, 0.065),
      ac2 = mobest::create_kernel(row$ds, row$ds, row$dt, 0.08)
    )
  }) %>%
  magrittr::set_names(paste("kernel", 1:length(.), sep = "_")) %>%
  do.call(mobest::create_kernset_multi, .)

interpol_comparison <- mobest::crossvalidate(
  independent = positions,
  dependent = observations,
  kernel = kernels_to_test,
  iterations = 2,
  groups = 10,
  quiet = T
)
```

### HPC setup for large lengthscale parameter spaces



<!--
## Maximum likelihood estimation

`mobest::laGP_mle_anisotropic` wraps around `laGP::mleGPsep` to perform marginal maximum likelihood inference for anisotropic (separable) Gaussian lengthscale and nugget parameters.

```r
mleGPsep_out <- mobest::laGP_mle_anisotropic(
  independent = dplyr::mutate(positions, x = x/1000, y = y/1000),
  dependent = observations,
  iterations = 2,
  verb = 0
)
```

`mobest::laGP_jmle_anisotropic` does the same, but for joint maximum likelihood inference.

```r
jmleGPsep_out <- mobest::laGP_jmle_anisotropic(
  independent = dplyr::mutate(positions, x = x/1000, y = y/1000),
  dependent = observations,
  iterations = 2,
  verb = 0
)
```

`mobest::laGP_mle_sequence_isotropic_fixed_g` implements a very specific approach, where the mle is performed under the assumption of an isotropic system, but with a series of scaling factors to explore the space-time-relation. The nugget term g is fixed.

```r
mle_sequence <- mobest::laGP_mle_sequence_isotropic_fixed_g(
  independent = dplyr::mutate(positions, x = x/1000, y = y/1000),
  dependent = observations,
  iterations = 2,
  g = c(ac1 = 0.1, ac2 = 0.1),
  space_time_scaling_factor_sequence = seq(0.1, 2, 0.1),
  verb = 0
)
```
