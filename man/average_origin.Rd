\arguments{
\item{window_start}{Start date of the moving window sequence}

\item{window_stop}{Stop date of the moving window sequence}

\item{window_width}{Width of each individual moving window}

\item{window_step}{Frequency of moving windows. Example:
If the first window starts at -3500 and extends until -3200, should the next
one start at -3450 or -3400, so with window_step = 50 or window_step = 100?}
